# This is my explanation

1. First, I defined the multipliers as SAVINGS and CHECKINGS
2. Next, I created a function for when adding to the savings account 
3. After, I created a function for adding to the savings account in which the total amount would be split by the SAVINGS and CHECKINGS into both accounts
4. Then, I used the origional function for saturdays_bank_transactions to show the starting point of the two accounts
5. Under the same function I input the values that will be going to the checking account and the values that will be going to both accounts in the next row
6. Finally, I kept the "if" statement to modularize our code and the data values for the transactions to be used in the code
7. Overall, I made functions for both accounts and condensed all of the transactions into their corresponding function while keeping the starting points of the accounts and the "if" statement to modularize my code which includes the transaction values, the new balances and what is printed
